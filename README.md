This proeject uses a dataset about fatal police shooting in the US that I found on Kaggle.

It is meant to be an introductory project to get used with different packages for data science like seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn. Although the main dataset was already collected on Kaggle, I was still have to collect some additional datas to help answering my research question. The project goes through a life cycle of a data science project (eventhough still not fully): collecting data, cleaning data, preprocess data, building models, and writing reports. 

The report of this project was also posted on Kaggle.
